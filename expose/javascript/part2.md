1. 3 because it is the last value of i after the for loop finishes
2. 150 becuase that is the discounted price of the last value in prices
3. 150 because that is the last final price of the last value in prices
4. [50, 100, 150]. It will return an array of length 3 containing the discounted prices. 50 is the first value because 50% of 100 is 50, 100 for 50% of 200, 150 for 50% of 300.
5. error: i is not defined because it can only be accessed iwthin the for loop
6. error: discountedPrice not defined because the variable is defined as let and can only be used within the for loop
7. 150 because that is the last final price of the last value in prices
8. [50, 100, 150]. It will return an array of length 3 containing the discounted prices. 50 is the first value because 50% of 100 is 50, 100 for 50% of 200, 150 for 50% of 300.
9. error: i is not defined because it can only be accessed iwthin the for loop

17. [2,4,6] because the function passed as callback returns double the input number. We loop through the original array and for each value push the returned value of teh callback function into a newArray. As teh returned value is double the orginal value, the new away contains 3 values, duoble the value of each element in the original array.
